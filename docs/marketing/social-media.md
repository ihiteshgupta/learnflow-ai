**Tweet 2 (What it does):**
Dronacharya has 6 AI agents, each with a specific role:

- Tutor: Socratic questioning
- Assessor: Adaptive quizzes
- Mentor: Career guidance
- Code Review: Security + quality analysis
- Project Guide: Portfolio help
- Quiz Generator: RAG-based questions from course content

**Tweet 4 (Tech stack):**
Built with:
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- LangChain + Claude + GPT-4
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Qdrant for RAG
- Tailwind CSS 4

Deployed on Azure. Open beta.

**Tweet 5 (CTA):**
Try it free: www.dronacharya.app

Three domains in beta:
- Python (fundamentals to advanced)
- Data Science (pandas, NumPy, visualization)
- AI/ML (machine learning foundations)

Feedback welcome. DMs open.

## LinkedIn Post

I'm excited to announce the launch of Dronacharya — an AI-powered learning platform I've been building.

Named after the legendary teacher from Mahabharata, Dronacharya uses 6 specialized AI agents to teach programming, data science, and AI/ML. Each agent has a focused role: tutoring via Socratic method, adaptive assessment, career mentoring, code review, project guidance, and RAG-based quiz generation.

What makes it different from generic AI chatbots:
- Each agent is purpose-built for a specific type of learning interaction
- Full gamification system (XP, levels, streaks, achievements)
- Three certification tiers with verifiable credentials
- Personalized learning paths that adapt to your pace

Tech stack: Next.js 16, LangChain, Claude + GPT-4, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, deployed on Azure.

Currently in open beta with three learning domains. I'd love your feedback.

**Title:** I built a free AI learning platform with 6 specialized teaching agents — looking for beta testers

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

I've been building Dronacharya (www.dronacharya.app) — an AI-powered learning platform where different AI agents handle different aspects of teaching:

- **Tutor** asks Socratic questions instead of giving answers directly
- **Assessor** creates quizzes that adapt to your level
- **Code Review** catches bugs and security issues in your code
- **Project Guide** helps you build real portfolio projects

Currently has three domains in beta: Python, Data Science, and AI/ML.

It also has gamification (XP, streaks, levels, achievements) which honestly makes me use it more than I expected.

Free to use, no credit card needed. Would appreciate any feedback — especially on the AI interactions and course content.

Built with Next.js, LangChain, Claude + GPT-4, PostgreSQL. Solo dev project.

### r/artificial

**Title:** Built an AI learning platform with specialized agents for different teaching styles — lessons from using LangChain + Claude in production

**Body:**
I just launched Dronacharya, an AI learning platform that uses 6 specialized agents instead of a single general-purpose chatbot.

The key insight: different learning interactions need different AI behaviors. A tutoring conversation needs Socratic questioning. An assessment needs structured evaluation. Code review needs security awareness.

Each agent has its own system prompt, tools, and evaluation criteria. Built with LangChain, Claude (primary) + GPT-4 (fallback), and Qdrant for RAG-based content retrieval.

Some things I learned:
- Specialized agents with narrow prompts perform much better than one general agent
- RAG quality depends heavily on chunking strategy
- Streaming responses are essential for the tutoring experience
- Rate limiting per-agent prevents runaway costs

www.dronacharya.app — free beta, would love feedback from this community on the AI interactions.

### r/webdev

**Title:** Launched my side project: AI learning platform built with Next.js 16, tRPC, Drizzle ORM

**Body:**
Just shipped Dronacharya (www.dronacharya.app) — an AI-powered learning platform.

Tech stack for the curious:
- Next.js 16 (App Router) with TypeScript
- tRPC + Hono for API
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
- LangChain + Claude/GPT-4 for AI
- Qdrant for vector search (RAG)
- NextAuth.js v5 for auth
- Zustand + TanStack Query for state
- Azure App Service for hosting

Has gamification (XP, streaks, achievements), 6 AI teaching agents, and three learning domains in beta.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or any specific tech choices.
